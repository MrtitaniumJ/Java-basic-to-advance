// Every Java program starts with a class
public class HelloWorld {
    // The main method is the entry point of any Java application. It's must have.
    public static void main(String[] args) { // String[] args is used to accept command-line arguments.
        // The code goes inside the main method
        System.out.println("Hello, World!"); // print text to the console
    }
}

// To run this program:
// 1. Save the file as HelloWorld.java
// 2. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing the file
// 3. Compile the program using: javac HelloWorld.java
// 4. Run the compiled program using: java HelloWorld
// This will display: Hello, World!
// This is a simple Java program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console.
// Comments in Java start with // for single-line comments
// and /* ... */ for multi-line comments.
// Java is case-sensitive, so "System" and "system" would be different identifiers.
// Java uses curly braces {} to define blocks of code, such as classes and methods.
// The main method must be declared as public static void to be recognby the Java runtime.
// The String[] args parameter allows the program to accept command-line arguments.
// The System.out.println() method is used to print text to the console, followed by a new line.
// The semicolon (;) at the end of the line indicates the end of a statement.
// Java programs are typically compiled into bytecode, which can be run on any platform with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
// This program demonstrates the basic structure of a Java application.
// It includes a class definition, the main method, and a simple print statement.

// Java is not just a programming language, it's a complete ecosystem for building robust, scalable applications.
// It is widely used for web development, mobile applications (Android), enterprise software, and more.
// java follows the object-oriented programming (OOP) paradigm, which promotes code reusability and modularity.
// Java has a rich standard library that provides many built-in classes and methods for various functionalities.
