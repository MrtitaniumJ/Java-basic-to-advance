# AI Agent Instructions for Java Learning Project

## Project Overview
This is a beginner-level Java learning workspace focused on fundamental Java programming concepts. The project structure is deliberately simple to support educational goals.

## Development Environment
- **Language**: Java (educational/beginner level)
- **Platform**: Windows with PowerShell
- **Compilation**: Standard `javac` command-line compilation
- **Execution**: Direct `java` execution

## Key Patterns & Conventions

### File Structure
- Source files use `.java` extension with class names matching filenames
- Compiled bytecode files (`.class`) are generated in the same directory
- Follow standard Java naming conventions: PascalCase for classes, camelCase for methods/variables

### Development Workflow
```powershell
# Compile Java source
javac ClassName.java

# Run compiled program
java ClassName
```

### Code Standards
- Use standard Java syntax and conventions
- Include proper `main` method signature: `public static void main(String[] args)`
- Use `System.out.println()` for console output in learning examples
- Keep examples simple and educational - focus on demonstrating specific concepts clearly

## Learning Focus Areas
When creating or modifying Java code in this workspace:
- Prioritize readability and educational value over complex optimizations
- Include comments explaining Java concepts being demonstrated
- Use descriptive variable names that help explain the code's purpose
- Structure examples to build incrementally in complexity

## Common Tasks
- **New Java Class**: Create `.java` file with class name matching filename
- **Testing Code**: Use simple `main` method with console output for verification
- **Error Checking**: Watch for common beginner mistakes (missing semicolons, incorrect method signatures, case sensitivity)

## Important Notes
- This is a learning environment - prefer clear, demonstrative code over production patterns
- Focus on fundamental Java concepts: variables, methods, control structures, object-oriented basics
- Keep examples self-contained and runnable from the command line
- Use the workspace for incremental learning exercises and concept exploration
