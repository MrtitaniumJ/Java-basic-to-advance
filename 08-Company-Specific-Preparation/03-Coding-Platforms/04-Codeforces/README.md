## Rating System & Divisions

### Elo-Based Rating System

Codeforces uses a sophisticated Elo rating system adapted for competitive programming:

- **Initial Rating**: 0 for new users
- **Rating Dynamics**: Calculated based on expected performance vs. actual performance
- **Division Assignment**: Rating determines which contests you can participate in
- **Volatile Ratings**: New users (first 6 contests) experience volatile rating swings
- **Rating Floors**: Divisions prevent rating collapse for established users

### Rating Tiers & Divisions

```
Division 4 (Div 4): 0 - 1199 (Absolute beginners)
Division 3 (Div 3): 0 - 1599 (Beginner to early intermediate)
Division 2 (Div 2): 0 - 2099 (Intermediate programmers)
Division 1 (Div 1): 1900+ (Advanced programmers)

Expert: 2000+ (Red color - significant achievement)
Master: 2400+ (Highly skilled competitor)
Grandmaster: 2600+ (Elite competitor)
International Grandmaster: 3000+ (Among world's best)
```

### Rating Mechanics
- **Positive Performance**: Beating expected difficulty scores gives rating gains
- **Negative Performance**: Underperformance results in rating losses
- **Problem Difficulty**: Harder problems beaten by fewer participants, giving more rating
- **Timing**: Faster solutions for same problems score more points
