Do's:
- ✓ Specific reasons tied to your values

- ✓ Express enthusiasm genuinely

Don'ts:
- ❌ "It's a good opportunity" (generic)

- ✓ Show flexibility

Don'ts:
- ❌ Unrealistic expectations
- ❌ "Micromanagement is okay" (red flag for you)
- ❌ "I just want to be left alone"

teams where we help each other grow. I prefer managers who provide context
for decisions and are open to discussion. I'm self-directed but appreciate
guidance on how to best contribute to team goals."
```

### Career Progression and Growth

**"Where do you see yourself in 5 years?"**

What They're Assessing: Ambition level, growth mindset, alignment with company direction

Do's:
- ✓ Show ambition without being unrealistic
- ✓ Mention growth areas (skills, leadership)
- ✓ Consider company context
- ✓ Express desire to deepen expertise

Don'ts:
- ❌ "Your competitor's CEO"
- ❌ "I don't care about growth"

Do's:
- ✓ Choose real weakness, not strength disguised

- ✓ Be specific with concrete example
- ✓ Keep it from becoming deal-breaker

Don'ts:
- ❌ "I'm too much of a perfectionist" (suspicious)
- ❌ Something core to job requirements
- ❌ No improvement plan
- ❌ Made-up weakness

**Example**:
```
"I sometimes focus so deeply on getting technical details right that I can
lose sight of the bigger timeline. I've worked on this by setting interim
checkpoints and communicating more frequently with stakeholders. I've found
that brief daily syncs help me stay aligned."
```

### Handling Difficult Questions

**"What didn't you like about your previous job?"**

Do's:

reason this role excites me—your company's approach matches my work style."
```

**"Do you have any concerns about this role or company?"**

Do's:
- ✓ Show you've thought deeply
- ✓ Ask clarifying questions
- ✓ Raise genuine concerns constructively
- ✓ Be open to addressing concerns

Don'ts:

better is how your team handles technical debt vs. feature development.
How do you balance shipping new features with maintaining system quality?
This will help me understand my potential impact."
```

## Salary Negotiation Strategies

### Research and Preparation

**Before Negotiations**:

**1. Know Market Rates**
- Use **Levels.fyi**: Tech compensation by company/level
- Check **Glassdoor**: Company-specific salary data
- Review **PayScale**: Role-based compensation
- Ask **Trusted Mentors**: Industry-specific rates
- Consider **Geographic Location**: Bay Area vs. Midwest differences

**2. Gather Data**:
```
Research Template:
- Position Title: ________
- Experience Level: ________
- Location: ________
- Company Size: Large / Medium / Startup

Market Rate Ranges Found:
- Glassdoor: $____k - $____k
- Levels.fyi: $____k - $____k
- PayScale: $____k - $____k
- Mentor Intel: $____k - $____k

Average Range: $____k - $____k
My Target: $____k
Minimum Acceptable: $____k
```

**3. Consider Total Compensation**
- Base salary (40-50%)
- Bonus (10-25%)
- Stock options/RSUs (10-30%)
- Benefits (health, 401k, PTO)
- Flexibility (remote, hours)
- Growth opportunities

### Negotiation Principles

**1. Let Them Make Offer First**
- Delay salary discussion if possible
- Avoid anchoring too early
- Build your value first
- Wait for official offer

**2. Be Professional and Calm**
- Treat negotiation as business discussion
- Don't get emotional
- Stay friendly throughout
- Remember: both parties benefit from agreement

**3. Negotiate Total Compensation**
- Don't focus only on salary
- Discuss bonus structure
- Negotiate stock vesting
- Address benefits
- Discuss flexibility options

**4. Use Data-Driven Arguments**
- Reference market data
- Explain your value clearly
- Provide industry benchmarks
- Use concrete examples

### Negotiation Process

**Step 1: Receive Offer**
```
When you get offer email:
- Say thank you
- Don't accept immediately
- Request timeline for response
- Ask for written confirmation
```

**Step 2: Review Offer**
```
Ask yourself:
- How does this compare to market?
- Does it match my minimum acceptable?
- What gaps exist from my target?
- What can be negotiated?
```

**Step 3: Prepare Your Response**
```
Research:
- Market rates (thoroughly)
- Total compensation breakdown
- Specific asks (salary, bonus, stock)
- Alternative benefits if needed
```

**Step 4: Open Negotiation**
```
GOOD: "Thank you for the offer. Based on market data for this level
and role, I was expecting a range closer to $X-Y. Can we discuss
adjusting the offer?"

BAD: "I need more money."
BAD: "That's too low."
```

**Step 5: Discuss and Adjust**
```
When they counter:
- Listen to their constraints
- Ask questions to understand
- Propose alternative arrangements
- Find win-win solutions
```

**Step 6: Reach Agreement**
```
When satisfied:
- Get revised offer in writing
- Confirm all terms
- Express appreciation
- Set start date
```

### Sample Negotiation Conversation

```
THEM: "We're offering $150,000 base salary."

YOU: "Thank you for the offer! I appreciate it. Based on my research
of market rates for this role and level in [location], the typical
range is $160-180k. Given my experience with [relevant examples],
I was hoping to discuss adjusting this to $165k base."

THEM: "That's higher than our typical budget. We're limited to $155k."

YOU: "I understand budget constraints. What if we looked at the total
package? Could we discuss:
1. Stock options structure—how much and vesting?
2. Sign-on bonus for [reason]?
3. Professional development budget?

This might help bridge the gap."

THEM: "We can do $155k base + $160k in stock options over 4 years
+ $10k sign-on bonus."

YOU: "That's helpful. Let me make sure I understand:
[Confirm numbers]

That gets us close. One question—what's the stock vesting schedule?
And is there any flexibility on the sign-on bonus given my constraints?"
```

### Handling Negotiation Challenges

**If They Won't Budge**:
- Get maximum total compensation given constraints
- Negotiate other benefits (flexibility, PTO, bonus)
- Request future raise timeline
- Negotiate stock refresh cycles
- Accept or decline, but never accept in anger

**If They Drop Offer**:
- This is unprofessional and rare
- Document everything
- Reconsider if you want to work there
- Consult with trusted mentor
- Proceed carefully

**If They Rush You**:
- "I appreciate the timeline. I want to give this proper consideration.
  Can I respond by [date]?"
- Don't rush into bad decision
- Take reasonable time even if pressured

## Benefits Discussion

### Health Insurance

**What to Ask**:
- **Plan Types**: PPO, HMO, HDHP options available?
- **Premium Cost**: Your share vs. company share?
- **Deductibles**: Out-of-pocket costs?
- **Coverage**: Dental, vision included?
- **Mental Health**: Therapy coverage?
- **Company Contribution**: Does company contribute to HSA?

**Key Metrics**:
```
Total Cost = Your Premium + Deductible + Out-of-pocket max
Effective Cost = Whether plan covers your doctors/hospitals
```

### Retirement Planning

**401(k) Details**:
- Employer match percentage?
- Vesting schedule? (immediate vs. 4-year cliff)
- Investment options available?
- Can you contribute beyond standard amount?

**Example Calculation**:
```
Salary: $200,000
Company Match: 4% of salary = $8,000/year FREE money
Vesting: 4-year cliff = you lose it if you leave before 4 years
Value: $8,000/year × 4 years = $32,000 benefit of staying

This affects your total value calculation significantly
```

### Time Off and Flexibility

**Vacation/PTO**:
- Paid days off per year?
- Can unused days roll over?
- How much paid time for sick leave?
- Parental leave provisions?

**Flexibility**:
- Remote work policy?
- Flexible hours?
- Work from home options?
- Compression weeks (4x10 hour days)?

**Value Calculation**:
```
Remote: Save 10 hours/week commute = 500 hours/year
That's worth 12.5 work weeks (salary × 12.5 weeks) + life quality

Flexible hours: Work when most productive (might boost output 20%)
```

### Professional Development

**What to Ask**:
- Annual training budget?
- Conference attendance support?
- Course reimbursement?
- Mentorship program?
- Educational leave?

### Equity/Stock Options

**Critical Questions**:
- Strike price?
- Vesting schedule? (standard: 4 years with 1-year cliff)
- Exercise window after leaving? (usually 90 days)
- Are these ISOs (better tax treatment) or NSOs?
- What's the company's valuation and path to exit?

**Understanding Stock Value**:
```
100,000 stock options at $1 strike price (current price $10)
Intrinsic value: 100,000 × ($10 - $1) = $900,000
BUT:
- Only vests over 4 years
- Can lose it if you leave before vesting
- Stock is only valuable if company succeeds
- Liquidity events (IPO or acquisition) might be years away
```

## Career Progression Questions

### Understanding Growth Path

**Ask About**:
- "What does the next level (senior engineer, staff engineer) look like?"
- "How do engineers progress in your company?"
- "What skills/projects would prepare me for that level?"
- "How long does each level typically take?"
- "Are there different tracks (IC vs. management)?"

**Example Response to Understand**:
```
THEM: "Most engineers reach senior engineer level in 3-4 years."

GOOD FOLLOW-UP: "What typically prepares someone for that level?
Are there specific projects or responsibilities that signal readiness?"

This shows you're planning your growth.
```

### Mentorship Opportunities

**Ask About**:
- "What mentorship is available for new engineers?"
- "Who would be my direct manager/mentor?"
- "How involved are senior engineers in helping others grow?"
- "Are there structured onboarding or mentorship programs?"

### Learning and Development

**Ask About**:
- "What opportunities exist to learn new technologies?"
- "Do you support employees attending conferences?"
- "Is there a technical reading culture?"
- "How do engineers develop leadership skills?"
- "Are there internal talks or tech sessions?"
