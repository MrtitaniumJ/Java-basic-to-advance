## Overview

Landing a job at top-tier technology companies requires strategic preparation, deep understanding of technical concepts, and practice with real-world interview scenarios. This guide provides a structured approach to prepare for interviews at major tech companies including FAANG (Facebook/Meta, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Google), Indian MNCs (TCS, Infosys, Wipro, HCL), and coding-focused platforms.

### Why Company-Specific Preparation?

Different companies have distinct interview processes, evaluation criteria, and technical focuses:

- **FAANG Companies**: Emphasize system design, algorithmic problem-solving, and behavioral fit. They typically follow a standardized interview process with multiple rounds.
- **Indian MNCs**: Focus on foundational Java knowledge, enterprise patterns, and aptitude. They often have multiple candidates and structured assessment processes.
- **Coding Platforms**: Leetcode-style problems, optimization, and competitive programming elements. Performance-based evaluation.
- **Mock Interviews**: Real-world simulation of actual interview experiences, providing feedback and confidence building.

### Interview Process Overview

Most tech companies follow a similar multi-stage process:

1. **Screening Round**: Initial phone/video call to assess basic competencies
2. **Coding Round**: 1-3 technical interviews focused on problem-solving
3. **System Design Round**: Architecture and design patterns (for senior positions)
4. **Behavioral Round**: Cultural fit, communication, and past experiences
5. **Final Round**: May include onsite visit or final clarifications
